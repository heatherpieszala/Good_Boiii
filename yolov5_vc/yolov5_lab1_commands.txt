1. Git clone v3 class repo if you haven't already.
2. Download weights (best.pt) from project repo
3. Move weights to /v3/week01/lab
4. cd /v3/week01/lab

docker build -t yolov5 -f Dockerfile.yolov5 .
xhost +
MODEL=yolov5s.pt
CAM=0

(create docker container, same command from lab01 without --rm flag, has a command to gitclone yolov5)
5. docker run -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY --privileged -v /tmp:/tmp -ti yolov5

(get docker container id in separate terminal window)
6. docker ps 

(weights are best.pt, copy them into the docker container)
6. docker cp best.pt docker_container_id:/best.pt

(move best.pt into the yolov5 directory)
7. cd ../../../../
8. mv best.pt usr/src/app/yolov5
9. cd usr/src/app/yolov5

(run main command to do inference)
10. python3 detect.py --weights best.pt --source 0

11. You'll probably get an error - most likely because the version of yolov5 the lab docker container clones is an older branch?
I did 'git pull origin main', but if you just do 'git pull' there are multiple options/branches that you may want to try 

12. If you did do 'git pull origin main', you'll probably need to re-install:
pip3 install pandas
pip3 install seaborn 
pip3 install -r requirements.txt


(run main command again - may take a while.)
13. python3 detect.py --weights best.pt --source 0
