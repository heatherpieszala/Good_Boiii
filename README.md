### Abstract
Ever wonder what your dog is doing when you are not watching?  What about when you are not home?  You might say, I have a camera for that. However, does your camera know when your dog is misbehaving and encourage it to engage in positive behavior instead?  Most likely, it does not. You might also know your dog misbehaves when you leave the room though it is difficult to determine when, and therefore,difficult to successfully work on training it otherwise. That is what our team set out to do and why we wanted to do it.  However, with time constraints and limited access to negative dog behavior data, we decided to focus on the positive behavior portion of the pipeline first.  For the purposes of this analysis, positive behavior means: sit, lay, stand, and play. The following study outlines the approach taken to solve this problem.
